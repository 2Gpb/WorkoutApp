# WorkoutApp

This is my first iOS project, built using UIKit. The app consists of 6 screens and demonstrates basic networking capabilities using `URLSession`. It is a practice project aimed at learning and improving iOS development skills.

### Key features
- **Networking:** Fetches and displays news from a simple API.
- **Basic Navigation:** Screens are connected using `UINavigationController` and `TabBarController`.
- **Adaptable Layout:** Designed to work across different iPhone screen sizes.

#### This application implements:
- UIKit | AutoLayout
- URLSession
- SOLID
